# hashAlgorithm
Not-so-smart hashing algorithm for the Blockchain class.

# Features
- Single function  to generate a constant length hash from any string
- Reasonably fast and efficient for diferent inputs
- Lithuanian symbols support
- Random enough to satisfy requirments of the task

 
# Improvements to make

- Beggining of the hash is not random enough, need to find a more optimised solution
- Only 20 hard-coded ASCII characters supported for the hash, increase this amount

# How to run?

Simply compile the stringToHash.cpp with your favorite compiler. You can also pass command line arguments.
